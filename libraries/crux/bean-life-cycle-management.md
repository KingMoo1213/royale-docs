## Manually Creating and Destroying Beans {#create-destroy-beans}

Crux provides an event-based mechanism to create or destroy beans. To create a new bean, you can dispatch the `BeanEvent.SET_UP_BEAN` or `BeanEvent.ADD_BEAN` events:

```as3
[Dispatcher]
public var dispatcher : IEventDispatcher;
 
private function createNewBean() : void
{
    var userModel : UserModel = new UserModel();
     
    // Crux will create a bean for the userModel, and process any metadata in it.
    dispatcher.dispatchEvent( new BeanEvent( BeanEvent.SET_UP_BEAN, userModel ) );
}
```

Both `SET_UP_BEAN` and `ADD_BEAN` will process the target object as a bean. The difference between these events is that `ADD_BEAN` will also add the bean as a singleton to the `BeanFactory` cache, while `SET_UP_BEAN` does not add the new bean to the cache.

Similarly, to destroy a bean, you dispach the `BeanEvent.TEAR_DOWN_BEAN` or `BeanEvent.REMOVE_BEAN` events:

```as3
private function destroyBean() : void
{
    // Crux will destroy the userModel bean, clean up any injected objects, and delete any injection bindings.
    dispatcher.dispatchEvent( new BeanEvent( BeanEvent.TEAR_DOWN_BEAN, userModel ) );
}
```

The tear down events mirror the set up events discussed previously: `TEAR_DOWN_BEAN` cleans up the target by removing injections, event handlers, etc., while `REMOVE_BEAN` cleans up the bean as well as removing it from the singleton cache in the BeanFactory.

> Since `BeanEvent` is a **bubbling event**, you can dispatch it from a view. If you dispatch them from non-view beans, be sure you use an injected dispatcher so that Crux can handle the event.

If necessary, you can directly call the `setUpBean()` and `tearDownBean()` methods on the `BeanFactory`. Since these methods both take a `Bean` instance as an argument, you can use the `createBeanForSource()` method on the `BeanFactory` to generate a `Bean` instance that you can then pass into the set up and tear down methods. However, in general the event-based approach to creating and tearing down beans should be the preferred approach.

## [PostConstruct] and [PreDestroy] {#postconstruct-predestroy}

Crux provides two metadata tags which allow you to trigger methods when any bean is set up or torn down. You can decorate a public method with `[PostConstruct]` and that method will be invoked by the framework after the bean has been set up, had dependencies injected, and had mediators created. For example:

```as3
package org.apache.royale.quickcrux.controller
{
    import org.apache.royale.quickcrux.service.UserService;
 
    public class UserController
    {
        [Inject]
        public var userService : UserService;
 
        /**
         * [PostConstruct] methods are invoked after all dependencies are injected.
         */
        [PostConstruct]
        public function createDefaultUser() : void
        {
            userService.loadDefaultUser();
        }
    }
}
```

Similarly, a public method decorated with `[PreDestroy]` will be called when a bean is destroyed by Crux. This would happen if a UI component is removed from the stage, or a module is unloaded.

```as3
package org.apache.royale.quickcrux.controller
{
    import org.apache.royale.quickcrux.service.UserService;
 
    public class UserController
    {
        [Inject]
        public var userService : UserService;
 
        /**
         * [PreDestroy] methods are invoked when a bean is destroyed.
         */
        [PreDestroy]
        public function clearPollingTimer() : void
        {
            userService.stopPolling();
        }
    }
}
```

<!--
## CruxConfig Options {#cruxconfig-options}

Six configuration options are available in the `CruxConfig` object to specify how UI components are handled by the framework. These are setUpEventType, setUpEventPhase, setUpEventPriority, and the corresponding tearDownEventType, tearDownEventPhase, and tearDownEventPriority. Normally, you can leave these at their default values. But if you need to, you can modify these to alter how Crux creates and destroys beans that are UI components.

The default setUpEventType is "addedToStage". This means that whenever a UI component is added to the stage, Crux will inspect the component and process any metadata it finds. Any dependency injections and event mediators will happen at this time. As mentioned, you may change this value if "addedToStage" is not ideal for your situation. "creationComplete" is another commonly used setUpEventType.

Be careful if you use an event type that occurs early in the Royale component life cycle, such as "preinitialize", since child components have not been created yet.

At the other end of the bean life cycle, the default tearDownEventType is "removedFromStage". This means that when a UI component is removed from the stage, Crux will perform clean up activities such as removing event mediators.

If you require even more fine-grained control, you can specify alternative values for the phase and priority used for the set up and tear down of beans. Typically, these won't need to be changed, but the options are there in case they are needed.

You can also use the ISetUpValidator and ITearDownValidator interfaces with UI components to control whether set up or tear down are allowed.

## Crux and Royale Life Cycle Steps {#life-cycle-steps}

> Note that the Royale component lifecycle events shown in all of these tables outline the most common order, but that it is not universal. For example, when a Module is loaded, it will dispatch addedToStage before dispatching creationComplete. These inconsistencies are simply how the Royale SDK operates.

The following table shows the steps that Royale and Crux will go through on application startup:
