# Styling

Customizing the Look and Feel of your application

Apache Royale can plug different style classes that can manage different levels of styling features. Usually a Royale application will compose a Style class at the Application bead level like this:

```mxml
<js:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
	xmlns:js="library://ns.apache.org/royale/basic">
    ...
    <j:valuesImpl>
        <js:SimpleCSSValuesImpl />
    </j:valuesImpl>
    ...
```

## Implementations

- **SimpleCSSValuesImpl**: The SimpleCSSValuesImpl class implements a minimal set of CSS lookup rules that is sufficient for most applications and is easily implemented for SWFs. It does not support attribute selectors, descendant selectors, or id selectors. It filters on a custom `-royale-swf` media query but not other media queries. You can replace it in your app with other implementations that handle more complex selector lookups.

## Using Styles

- **SimpleCSSStyles**: Brings simple styles to Royale.

```mxml
<js:VContainer id="vb" width="100%" height="100%">
    <js:style>
        <js:SimpleCSSStyles paddingLeft="6" paddingTop="4" paddingRight="8" paddingBottom="4"/>
    </js:style>
</js:VContainer>
```

- **SimpleCSSStylesWithFlex**: Tries to support Flex styling properties.

```mxml
<js:PanelView>
    <js:titleBar>
        <js:TitleBar height="20">
            <js:style>
                <js:SimpleCSSStylesWithFlex backgroundColor="0xA65904" />
            </js:style>
        </js:TitleBar>
    </js:titleBar>
</js:PanelView>
```

## Themes

In Apache Royale, a theme is a predefined CSS file (and optionally other assets like images) that holds the definitions of each component, so adding a theme to your application or replacing the existing one will make your entire application change all visuals like colors, fonts and drawings that make you components and containers looks in a certain way.

In [Jewel](component-sets/jewel) UI Set styling and themeing is one of the key concepts, you can learn more about it here:
