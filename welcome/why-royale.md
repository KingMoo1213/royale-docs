# Why Royale?

The advantages of using Royale

Let's face it. There are lots of frameworks out there and each one claims to be the best. What does Royale give you that you don't get with other frameworks?

## Time Proven
Royale takes the best parts of Flex which was the first major web application framework. Flex was developed by the best in the field and Royale was designed by one of the lead architects of Flex.

## Battle Tested
Flex has run huge enterprise applications and Royale sits on the experience of that. Royale is being used to continue to run these applications which were originally developed in Flex.

## Safe
Royale is backed by Apache and offers the peace of mind knowing that Apache processes govern Royale's releases.

## Unopinionated
If you are using a framework, chances are you have been fighting with the framework to do what you want. You searched Stack Overflow to be told "you're doing it wrong". You need to use Framework "x" exactly like so!

In Royale, we don't tell you how to build your applications. You like OOP? Great! You like FP? Great! How to manage your state? However you like! You don't like dealing with async rendering loops? Great. Royale doesn't have them. You want to control exactly how and when something is rendered? You are in the driver seat.

You want to use dependency injection? Check. Don't like it? You don't need to use it.

In short, Royale gives you the tools you need and doesn't tell you have to use them.

## Fast!
Most frameworks try to get as close to vanilla javascript as they can. In Royale we try to be _faster_ than vanilla javascript. In most cases Royale will _beat_ the best performance you can squeeze out of native HTML and Javascript. That's because the DOM is only used when necessary and we never do any kind of DOM syncing or traversal.

## Zero configuration necessary
Out of the box, Royale will build both debug and release builds of your application. You don't need any external tools to package "tree shake" or what-have-you.

## Small and speedy deployments
Royale compiles your entire application into a single JS file, a single minified CSS file and a tiny HTML file. Your _entire deployment_ can often be smaller than 100KB. Because Royale knows a lot about your application, it can be very smart about what's included and what can be minified.

With Royale, the need for breaking your app into pieces and doing server side rendering to improve performance can be a thing of the past. You can get better performance out of Royale without any of those steps.

## The kitchen sink
Royale has a lot of functionality built in that you might otherwise look for elsewhere.

## Open
The Royale community is truly open. We're not run by some big company with an agenda. We don't care about politics. We're just little folk like you trying to build great software. We're waiting for you to join and help us build upon the best framework on earth!
