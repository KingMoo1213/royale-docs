# Jewel Form

Organize the forms in your application

## Overview

The Jewel Form component is a container to hold all the elements of a form. The elements are [FormItems](component-sets/jewel/jewel-formitem). Forms can include:

  - Instructions for how, when, or why to use the form
  - Input components (like text boxes, number steppers, color pickers, sliders, and date fields) in which the user provides information
  - Choice components (like checkboxes and radio buttons) where the user can select among options
  - Images or background colors to style the form
  - Action buttons where the user can submit or cancel the form, or choose some other action, triggering event handlers that process or clear the form
