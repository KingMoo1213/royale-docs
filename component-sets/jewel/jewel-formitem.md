# Jewel FormItem

## Overview
A Jewel FormItem holds a component within a form--it could be static content like a label, an image, or instructions; fields in which the form user makes selections or enters text; or buttons with which to submit, clear or cancel the form. The form designer can use FormItem properties like its height and width and whether it is a required field to control the form's layout and appearance.
